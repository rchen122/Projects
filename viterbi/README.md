This projects implements the viterbi algorithm using the Brown corpus dataset. This project demonstrates knowledge of tagging, HMM, and the Viterbi Algorithm. 

NOTE: I do not claim any of the code in utils.py as my own, they were provided by UIUC ECE 448. All code in submitted.py is my own code and implementation of the project. Functions of utils.py help format the dataset for my own functions.

To run the project, run main.py with python version 3.12. Terminal output displays the accuracy of both the tagger and the viterbi algorithm.
